# Humans and Superhumans

Make Unit tests for code you write. 

### Objectives

1. To demonstrate your understanding of objects and functions
2. To demonstrate your understanding of controlling execution
3. To demonstrate your understanding of access control
4. To demonstrate your understanding of reusing classes


### Overview

Complete the 'Human' class in the Superpowers Package that has fields for: name, age, gender, occupation, and address. Also create methods for retreiving and outputing this data to screen.

Then create a SuperHuman class and UNIT TEST that subclasses the first with fields for good or bad, hero name, super ability. As before, create methods for retrieving field data and printing to screen.

### Unit Test
UML is required
Unit test in  place before proceeding with code
Make sure you test EVERY public method

### Instructions

1. In your unit test initialize a human and superhuman instances
2. Demonstrate calling methods inherited from Human on your SuperHuman instances
